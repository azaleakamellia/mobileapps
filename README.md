# ü§≥üèª Mobile Application Suite (update 2022)

###### tags: `how-to` `mobile application` `gis` `spatially`

As of 2022, there has been major changes in the applications developed by Esri for field data collection and monitoring. Taking advantage of the opportunity with the given license, we will be exploring the usage of two major applications:

- üçÉ [Survey123 for ArcGIS](https://survey123.arcgis.com/) i.e Survey123
- üí´ [ArcGIS Field Maps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-field-maps/overview) i.e Field Maps

It used to be quite difficult to set up _Collector for ArcGIS_, thus, for the most part, we recommended the usage of Survey123 instead, although the shortcomings in 2018 is the complicated setup for polygon and lines data collection. 

Below are some of the references and details of demonstrations that can be accessed to understand the procedure of enabling the functions in both applications and tap into their full capabilities on the field. 

> :warning: **NOTE** <br />
> This note will be updated regularly with any relevant updates or trick/tips to ease the setup and usage of both product. This will be at the writer's discretion.

> :warning: **ANOTHER NOTE** <br />
> For Esri's applications i.e Survey123 or ArcGIS Field Maps, please ensure that you are subscribed to at least ArcGIS Personal License before trying the apps out. Should you be using public account, you won't have the access to create/publish/edit your own map.

## üì≤ [ArcGIS Field Maps](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/fieldmaps/)
**ArcGIS Field Maps** is an app that you install in your mobile device to enable access to any published **web maps** that you have in ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS. Bottom line is, if you have published data and it has been added to a web map and shared accordingly, you can access it from your phone via ArcGIS Field Maps app. 

Further demo will be updated here.

## üì≤ [ArcGIS Survey123](https://survey123.arcgis.com/)
**ArcGIS Survey123** is often the go-to option for field data collections that consist of point. But the app itself has been recently updated to enable line and polygon data collection. It was an anticipated update for those who refer the consistent workflow that comes from generating this form-centric maps. 

Survey123 works in any platform; Windows, Android and iOS, and its development can be done through the [website](https://survey123.arcgis.com/?signin=true&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fsurvey123.arcgis.com%2Fsurveys) or the nifty [Survey123 for ArcGIS Connect software](https://links.esri.com/survey123/connect-windows64).

Further demo will be updated here.
